You can filter which results are returned by most list endpoints (such as [List services](https://render-api.readme.io/reference/get-services)
). You provide filter values as query parameters separated by `&`, like so:

cURL

`curl --request GET \      --url 'https://api.render.com/v1/services?name=test-service&type=static_site' \      --header 'Accept: application/json' \      --header 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY_GOES_HERE'`

If a filter value includes reserved characters (such as spaces), make sure it's [URL-encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding)
.

For available filters, consult the reference page for each list endpoint.

Multi-value filters

[](#multi-value-filters)

------------------------------------------------

You can provide multiple values for a single filter, separated by an _unencoded_ comma (`,`). If you do, the endpoint returns results that match _any_ provided value for that filter.

For example, this request fetches all services of type `static_site` _or_ `web_service`:

cURL

`curl --request GET \      --url 'https://api.render.com/v1/services?type=static_site,web_service' \      --header 'Accept: application/json' \      --header 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY_GOES_HERE'`
