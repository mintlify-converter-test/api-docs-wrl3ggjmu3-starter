Endpoints that return a list of resources (such as [List services](https://render-api.readme.io/reference/get-services)
 and [List deploys](https://render-api.readme.io/reference/get-deploys)
) use **cursor-based pagination** to keep response sizes manageable. If your first request to a list endpoint doesn't return all results, you can send a followup request for the next "page" of results based on a cursor you provide.

How to use

[](#how-to-use)

------------------------------

To fetch paginated results, you provide the following query parameters in your requests to a list endpoint:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `limit` | The maximum number of results to return in a single response (i.e., the size of a single "page").    Default: `20`  Max: `100` |
| `cursor` | A unique string that corresponds to a position in the result list. If provided, the endpoint returns results that appear _after_ the corresponding position. |

When fetching your first "page" of results from a list endpoint, you _don't_ include the `cursor` query parameter. The endpoint returns a list of resource objects, each paired with its cursor:

JSON

`[   {     "cursor": "cfQ74cE2sDI=",     "service": {       "id": "srv-xxxxx",       "name" "Test Service",       ...     }   },   {     "cursor": "mpFjFKeYgnw=",     "service": {       "id": "srv-xxxxx",       "name" "A Second Service",       ...     }   }, ]`

Note that `cursor` is not a _member_ of the resource object, but instead is a sibling field.

If additional results are available, you can send another request to the endpoint. This time, set the `cursor` query parameter to the cursor of the _last_ resource returned in the _previous_ response, like so:

cURL

`curl --request GET \      --url 'https://api.render.com/v1/services?cursor=mpFjFKeYgnw=' \      --header 'Accept: application/json' \      --header 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY_GOES_HERE'`

This time, the endpoint returns results that immediately follow the cursor's position in the list. You can repeat this process until you've fetched all results.
