You authenticate all requests to the Render API with an **API key**. You can create and manage API keys from your [Account Settings page](https://dashboard.render.com/u/settings)
 in the Render Dashboard:

Every API key provides access to both your personal account _and_ any teams you belong to. Each resource object returned by the API includes an `owner_id` field that indicates which user or team owns that resource. For more details on resource ownership, see [Owners](https://render-api.readme.io/reference/owners-1)
.

> API keys are secret credentials!

> --------------------------------------
> 
> Don’t publicly post your API key, commit it to version control, or otherwise share it with anyone outside your organization.
> 
> If you believe an API key has been compromised, revoke it from the Render Dashboard and create a new one.

Providing an API key

[](#providing-an-api-key)

--------------------------------------------------

You include your API key in each request via the `Authorization` HTTP header:

`Authorization: Bearer API_KEY_GOES_HERE`

Consult your HTTP library's documentation for the recommended way to set this header.

To confirm that your API key works as expected, send your first API request with the following `curl` command (substitute your API key where indicated):

cURL

`curl --request GET \      --url 'https://api.render.com/v1/services?limit=3' \      --header 'Accept: application/json' \      --header 'Authorization: Bearer API_KEY_GOES_HERE'`
