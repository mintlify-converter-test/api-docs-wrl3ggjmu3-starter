description: "PATCH endpoints in the Render API allow you to update details of an existing resource, following certain conventions such as avoiding nested resources."
---
PATCH endpoints (such as [Update service](https://render-api.readme.io/reference/update-service)
) enable you to update details of an existing resource. The following conventions apply to PATCH endpoints in the Render API:

No nested resources

[](#no-nested-resources)

------------------------------------------------

PATCH endpoints are not used for updating nested resources. For example, if you want to manage custom domains for a service, you wouldn't do this through the Update service endpoint, but would instead use the [Add custom domain](https://render-api.readme.io/reference/create-custom-domain)
 and [Delete custom domain](https://render-api.readme.io/reference/delete-custom-domain)
 endpoints.

What gets updated?

[](#what-gets-updated)

---------------------------------------------

PATCH endpoints update any resource fields that you provide a new value for in your request body. This is true _even if a provided value is null/empty_. In this case, the endpoint removes or unsets the field for the resource.

Any resource fields you _omit entirely_ from your request body remain unchanged.
